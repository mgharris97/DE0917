## 🧮 Pythonic Arithmetic Parser in C
</div?>
## Goal
Write a C program that evaluates arithmetic expressions from text files using (mostly) Python’s operator rules and standard C (similar to Java) arithmetic semantics. The program must:

- Read an input file (or a directory of files).

- Parse and evaluate expressions.

- Report either the numeric result or a precise error location.

- Write the result to an output file with a specific naming convention.

---

## CLI & I/O
## Invocation

```
calc [-d DIR | --dir DIR] [-o OUTDIR | --output-dir OUTDIR] input.txt
```

- if `-d/--dir` is provided, **process all** `*.txt` files ***files in the DIR` (ignore subfolders)
- if `-o/--output-dir` is **omitted**, create a default output folder:
    `<input_base>_<username>_<studentid>`
    Example: `labs_valdis_12345/`
- if `-o/--output-dir` **is provided** and doe snot exist, create it

## Output file name
for each input `task1.txt`, produce
```task1_<name>_<lastname>_<studentid>.txt```
The file contains **either** the result (single line) **or** `ERROR:<pos>`
> **Character position** is **1-based,** counting every char in the file, including `\n` as one character

## Input Assumptions (Baseline)
- **ASCII** only.
- Whitespace may appear anywhere.
- At minimum (grade 4-6) inputs are **single line ≤ 100 chars** (later grades extend this)
- Expressions can be **integer** and, for higher grades, **float*8 (IEEE 754 double)

## Features by Grade (Rubric)
## Grade 4/10 - Minimal Pass
- Single line (≤ 100 chats)
- **Integers** only (base-10, optional leading `+`/`-`)
- **Operators:** `+``-` (binary)
- Output: numeric results (via integer text)
- On any parse/eval error: `ERROR:<pos>` (1-based char index)

## Grade 5/10 - Positioned Errors
- Same grade 4 **plus**
- **Accurate error position:** if the first error is at character 57, output `ERROR:57`.
    - Examples of errors: invalid token, unexpected end, two operators in a row, leading operator without operand, etc.

## Grade 6/10 - Multiplication (+ optional floats)
- Add `*` (binary).
- **Additional challenge:** support **floats (64-bit)** mixed with ints.
    - If floats are supported, print using `%.15g` (see Output formatting below).
- Still single line ≤ 100 chars.

# Grade 7/10 - Division
- Add `/` (true division if floats supported; otherwise integer division).

- Division by zero ⇒ `ERROR:<pos>` where `<pos>`is the **starting char index of the offending divisor token** (or the / token—either is acceptable if documented).

- **Additional challenge:** allow multiple lines and inputs up to **10,000 characters** total.

## Grade 8/10 — Parentheses

- Add `(` `)` with correct precedence and associativity.

- **Error reporting** must still work (unmatched paren should point to the problematic paren or place where the closing/opening was expected).

## Grade 9/10 — Comments & Batch Mode

- Ignore full lines that start with `#` (Pythonic line comments).
- Support `-d/--dir` to process all `*.txt` in a folder.
- Support `-o/--output-dir` to choose/create output folder.
- Default folder behavior when `-o` not provided as specified above.

## Grade 10/10 — Exponentiation & No Input Size Guarantees

- Add Python power operator: **
    - Right-associative (e.g.,` 2**3**2 == 2**(3**2) == 512`).
    - Higher precedence than `*` `/` and `+` `-`.
    - Precedence is just below unary operators (if you implement unary; see below).
- No specific length limits beyond “fits in Codespaces VM” (i.e., handle very long files efficiently).
- Maintain all prior features and error reporting.

## Language Semantics (Recommended Defaults)
## Tokens

- Integers: `0` or `[1-9][0-9]*` (optionally with leading `+`/`-` if you implement unary).
- Floats (if implemented): forms accepted by `strtod` are okay (e.g., `12.34`, `.5`, `1e-3`).
- Operators: `+` `-` `*` `/` `**`
- Parentheses: `(` `)`
- Whitespace: skip freely.
- Comments: **entire line** starting with `#` is ignored (from first non-space `#` to line end).

## Precedence & Associativity
From highest to lowest:
    1. `**`(right-associative)
    2. Unary `+` `-` (optional, left-to-right apply to a single primary)
    3. `*` `/` (left-associative)
    4. `+` `-` (left-associative)

> **Note**: You can reach 10/10 wihtout unary `+`/`-` If you **do** implement unary, document it and ensure it doesn'ty break error positions

## Numeric Types & Output Formatting
- Integers: use 64-bit (`long` `long`) for safety. Overflow handling is not required but certainly a bonus (document behavior if you detect it).
- Floats: use `double` (`strtod`).
- Result printing:
    - If your evaluator is int-only: print integer like `-42`.
    - If mixed numeric:
        - If the final value is integral (e.g., 3.0), print without decimal (e.g., `3`).
        - Else print with `%.15g`.
    - Trailing spaces/newlines: one newline at end is fine.

## Errors & Positions (Required)
On the **first** encounter error, stop and wrote:
```ERROR:<pos>```
- `<pos>` is **1-based char index** in the **entire file** (count `\n` as 1)
- Examples
    - `12 + * 5` → error at `*` position.
    - `((2+3)` → error at the place the parser expected `)` (you may choose to report at EOF position).
    - `10/0` → division by zero; report at the start of `0` (or the `/`)—be consistent and document.
> **Optional enhacements (not required for grade):** You may also write `ERROR:<line>:<col>` **in addition** to the required format on the next line

## Grammar (suggested, EBNFF-ish, but you can use something else)
You can implement via **recursive descent** or **shunting-yard**
If **no unary:**
```
expr    := term { ('+' | '-') term }
term    := power { ('*' | '/') power }
power   := primary { '**' primary }         // implement as right-associative
primary := NUMBER | '(' expr ')'
```

if **with unary:**
```
expr    := term { ('+' | '-') term }
term    := factor { ('*' | '/') factor }
factor  := power
power   := unary { '**' unary }             // right-assoc: parse power -> unary ( '**' power )?
unary   := ('+' | '-') unary | primary
primary := NUMBER | '(' expr ')'
```

## Examples
## Simple
input (`task1.txt`)
```
2+2
```
Output file:
```
task1_name_lastname_studentid.txt
```
Contents
```
4
```

## Error with position
```
7 + * 3
```
`*` is the 5th character (assuming single spaces). Output:
```
ERROR:5
```

## Parentheses & precedence
```
2 + 3*4
(2 + 3) * 4
```
→ `14` and `20`

## Power (Grade 10)
```
2**3**2
```
→ `512`

## Comments & multi-file (Grade 9+)
```
# this is ignored
2 + 3
```
→ `5`

## Implementation Hints (C, GCC on Ubuntu/Codespaces)
- **Tokenizer:** produce a stream of tokens (NUMBER, PLUS, MINUS, STAR, SLASH, POW, LPAREN, RPAREN, EOL/EOF) with each token carrying start index (1-based) for error reporting.
- **Numbers:** parse with `strtoll` (int) and/or `strtod` (double). **Keep original char index** for error pointing.
- **Parsing:**
    - **Recursive descent** is straightforward and keeps precedence clear.
    - For ** right-associativity, implement power := unary ('**' power)?.
- **Big input** (Grade 10): stream the file into memory (e.g., mmap or fread), but avoid quadratic concatenation. Tokenize once, then parse.
- **Error handling:**
    - Define a single function fail(pos, message) that stores the **first** error position.
    - Return early to short-circuit evaluation.
- **Division by zero:**
    - For ints: `b == 0` → error at token `b`.
    - For floats: if divisor numerically equals 0.0, treat as error (do **not** return `inf`).
- **Output directory:**
    - Use `mkdir` (POSIX) with `0775`. If it exists, proceed.
    - Build paths with `snprintf` safely.
- Globbing (`-d`): read directory entries, include files ending with `.txt` (case-sensitive).
- Comments: skip a line if first non-space char is `#`.
- Makefile: provide `make`, `make test`, `make run`.

## Project Submission Instructions
You must submit **exactly one file:**
```
calc.c
```
## File Header (Mandatory & Optional Lines)

The **first lines of your** `calc.c` **must follow this format:**
```
// Name Lastname StudentID
// (optional) GitHub repository link for this assignment
// Compilation instructions (e.g., gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -std=c17 -o calc calc.c)
```
- **Line 1:** Your full **Name, Lastname, StudentID**
- **Line 2** (Optional): link to your GitHub repo for this project
    - If provided and the repo is well-structured, it may improve grading.
- **Next Lines: any **special compilation or run instructions** if your program needs them beyond standard `gcc`

## Code Commenting Requirements
- Your `calc.c` must contain **plentiful, clear, and meaningful comments.**
- Focus on explaining **WHY you are doing something**, not just what the code does.
    - ✅ Good Example
    ```
    // Using recursive descent parsing here because it naturally reflects operator precedence
    ```
    - ❌ Bad Example
    ```
    // Add x and y
    ```
- If you use **external resources** (books, StackOverflow answers, documentation, AI prompts, etc.),
    - **cite them in comments** at the relevant place in the code
    - Example
    ```
    // Tokenizer logic inspired by K&R Chapter 5 example
    // Prompt used with ChatGPT: "recursive descent parser in C for arithmetic"
    ```

## Grading Notes
- **Unclear, missing, or low-quality comments will lower your grade.**
- **Bad or misleading comments** are worse than no comments.
- **Explicitly citing resources** you used is required. Failure to do so will negatively impact the grade.

👉 Only `calc.c` will be accepted. Do not upload Makefiles, executables, or multiple `.c/.h `files.

**Code quality modifiers** (up to ±1):
- +0.5: clear structure, no UB, checks for I/O errors, robust CLI.
- +0.5: concise tests and documentation.
- −1.0: memory leaks/UB/crashes on normal inputs.
- +-2.0: I reserve right to adjust grade UP or DOWN, based on code clarity, comments

## Anti-cheating & Libraries
- Do not shell out to Python/BC/expr/etc.
- No parser generators for the core (flex/bison) — write your own tokenizer & parser.
- If you use code assistance such as LLMs (all prompts are required in comments as well as specific tool!)
- Relying fully on LLM or others is against spirit of this assignment and will hurt you 

## Starter Test Ideas
**✅ Valid**
- `42`
- `10 + 20 - 5`
- `2 * 3 + 4`
- `2 + 3 * 4`
- `(2 + 3) * 4`
- `2**3**2`
- With floats (if supported ): `3/2`, `1.5*4`, `.5 + .25`, `1e3 + 2`

**❌ Invalid**
- `+` (no operand)
- '2 **' (trailing op)
- `2 /* 3`
- `((1+2)`
- `10/0`
- `2 ** ** 3`

## Timeline & Deliverables
- Submit on time
- -1 grade for being up to one week late
- -2 grade for being up to two weeks late

## Tips
- Keep a **global char index** during scanning to make `ERROR:<pos>` trivial.
- Store each token’s **start index**; on errors report the most relevant token’s start.
- To print integers from double results, check `fabs(val - llround(val)) < 1e-12`.
- For `**`, beware left-to-right bugs; test `2**3**2` rigorously.
